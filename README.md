*   **GNC Flight Control:** A robust command executor that interfaces with Kerbal Space Program (KSP) for precision flight operations
*   **Mission Plan Builder:** Professional-grade UI for designing, validating, and monitoring complex mission sequences
*   **Live Telemetry Dashboard:** Real-time web dashboard for monitoring critical flight data and system status
*   **AI Post-Mission Analyst:** Advanced AI-powered tool for natural language analysis of mission performance

This system showcases advanced software engineering principles including test-driven development, microservices architecture, and autonomous system orchestration. Designed to demonstrate professional-grade capabilities to aerospace and defense industry leaders.

## 2. üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The Orion GNC system employs a sophisticated autonomous architecture centered around the **Mission Sequencer** as the mission director. The system operates as a collection of specialized microservices that communicate through Redis Pub/Sub messaging and API gateways.

### ‚≠ê Architecture Highlights:

*   **Mission Sequencer:** Acts as the central brain, validating mission plans against JSON schemas and orchestrating command sequences
*   **Schema-Driven Validation:** Ensures mission integrity through formal contract validation using [`mission_plan_schema.json`](docs/schemas/mission_plan_schema.json:1)
*   **Real-Time Coordination:** Redis Pub/Sub enables seamless communication between services with live status broadcasting
*   **API Gateway Pattern:** UI server acts as a centralized proxy, simplifying frontend communication and improving security
*   **Autonomous Operation:** Mission Sequencer directs operations while GNC Flight Control executes commands with full autonomy

The architecture promotes enterprise-grade principles: modularity, scalability, testability, and fault tolerance.
